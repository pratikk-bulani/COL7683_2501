Quiz 1

1. 2 marks: Printer should have a spatial resolution of 200 pixels/cm, or 20 px/mm, or ~500 px/in (dots instead of pixels is also OK, e.g. 500 dpi). -0.5 marks if word "resolution" not mentioned. -0.5 marks if result given in units of pixels/area, e.g. 4k pixels/cm^2.

2. 2 marks: 0.5 marks: no, it is not linear. 1.5 marks: any valid counterexample. e.g. student picks some r in [k/2, k), then T(r) = 0 but T(2r) = L-1 != 2T(r).


Quiz 2

1. 2 marks: 0.5 marks for saying no, not possible. 1.5 marks for valid counterexample, e.g. f1 = [1,0] and f2 = [0,1] have same histogram h_f, but if g = [1,0] then f1 + g and f2 + g don't have same histogram.

2. 2 marks: Consider constant f(x,y) = c, then (w*f)(x,y) = sum c w(x,y) = c sum w(x,y). Output should be zero => sum w(x,y) = 0.



Quiz 3

1. 0.5 marks for saying false. 1.5 marks for valid counterexample, i.e. some nonlinear intensity transformation where relative ratios of R, G, B change.

2. 1 marks: Convolution with box has Fourier transform G(μ) = F(μ) sinc(μ) (0.5 mark for FT(box) = sinc, 0.5 mark for multiplication in frequency domain). 1 mark: Result after sampling is convolution with impulse train, writing either G~ = G * s_1 or G~(μ) = sum_n G(μ-n) is OK (0.5 mark for impulse train, 0.5 mark for convolution or sum in frequency domain).



Quiz 4

1. 1 mark: w is even => W is real and even. 1 mark: multiplication with real number doesn't change phase.

2. 2 marks: Intensity oscillations are ringing artifacts due to hard cutoff in frequency domain. Use smoother falloff through Gaussian or Butterworth.



Quiz 5

1. Mean: no (0.5 marks), we don't know the original intensities of the original image (0.5 marks). Variance: yes (0.5 marks), take variance of intensities of pixels in constant regions (0.5 marks).

2. Wiener filter: W = H*/(|H|^2 + Sn/Sf) (1 mark), becomes zero when H = 0 (1 mark) so noise is also zeroed out.



Quiz 6

1. Linearly independent: yes (0.5 marks), any valid justification (0.5 marks) e.g. for c0 t0(x) + c1 t1(x) + c2 t2(x) to be zero it has to be zero at x = 0, 1, 2 => c0 = c1 = c2 = 0. Orthogonal: no (0.5 marks), integral t0(x) t1(x) dx is not zero (0.5 marks).

2. Plot of s0 should be constant sqrt(1/N) (0.25 marks), s1 should be decreasing from sqrt(2/N) to -sqrt(2/N) (0.25 marks). cos(..) has all values 1 when u = 0 while it has some values less than 1 when u != 0, so needs larger normalization (0.5 marks).



Quiz 7

1. If phi_00 = f, then phi_10 is box on (-1/4, 1/4) (1 mark). phi_1k's are boxes on (-1/4, 1/4), (1/4, 3/4), (3/4, 5/4), ..., linear combination can't reproduce f (1 mark). (OR: f is in V0 but not in V1.)

2. H = -sum p log p = -0.5 log 0.5 - 255 * (1/510 log 1/510) = 0.5 + 1/2 * 9 = 5. 2 marks



Quiz 8

1. Apply definition of erosion (1 mark). Result = {9 <= x <= 19, 10 <= y <= 20} (1 mark)

2. Opening: only big squares remain (1 mark). Closing of opening: bridge between squares returns (1 mark).



Quiz 9

1. Without Gaussian smoothing: spurious edges detected due to noise (1 mark). Without non-max suppression: detected edges are thick instead of 1 pixel wide (1 mark).

2. EITHER: \sigma_B^2 = P1 P2 (m1 - m2)^2 (1 mark), if k -> 0 or 255 then P1 -> 0 or P2 -> 0 (1 mark). OR: \sigma_B^2 = P1 (m1 - mG)^2 + P2 (m2 - mG)^2 (1 mark), if k -> 0 then P1 -> 0 and m2 -> mG and vice versa when k -> 255 (1 mark).



Quiz 10

1. EITHER: watershed segmentation (1 mark) on gradient magnitude (0.5 marks) with known pixels as markers (0.5 marks). OR: graph cut (1 mark) with region costs only on known pixels (1 mark).

2. (a) large because gradients in all directions, (b) large because both horizontal and vertical gradients, (c) small because only horizontal gradients, (d) large because gradients in all directions. 0.5 marks each.
