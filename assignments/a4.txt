Q1

a. Dilation should make all the letters thick. Closing should connect gaps between letters.

b. Only one or a few c's (and maybe some e's) will be selected. Other c's that differ by even one missing pixel will fail to match.

c. Erosion of B by a small SE will work.

d. Dilate B by a small amount and take its boundary (see Lecture 21 slide 22).



Q2

a. See L22.S11.

b. See L22.S14. The SE should be wider than the widest blood vessel, so that closing removes all blood vessels.

c. Closing with a disk wider than the widest gap. (Dilation instead of closing will remove the gaps but also thicken the vessels.)

d. Opening with different disks of different widths w, then compute "surface area" S = sum of intensities (L22.S16-17). Plot either S or |dS/dw| as a function of w. Values of w where S decreases, or |dS/dw| is large, correspond to typical thickness values.



Q3

a. Produce images similar to L23.S25-26.

b. Hough transform image should look similar to L23.S33 bottom left (see also https://sbme-tutorials.github.io/2021/cv/notes/4_week4.html).

c. See L23.S33 bottom right and https://sbme-tutorials.github.io/2021/cv/notes/4_week4.html



Q4

a. Student may have to work out P1, P2, m1, m2 to finally derive σ^2_B in 3 cases: (i) -b < k < b, (ii) b < k < 1-a, (iii) 1-a < k < 1+a. I have not worked out exact formula yet, may try later if I have time. Correct segmentation is when maximum of σ^2_B occurs in b < k < 1-a. Incorrect segmentation if maximum occurs in one of 2 other cases.

b. If either b > 1/2 or a > 1/2, some pixels change their assignment and cluster means move away from true class means. Reason for possible agreement/disagreement with Otsu's method: both k-means and Otsu minimize within-class variance and maximize between-class variance, but k-means stops at a local optimum while Otsu finds the global optimum.



Q5

a. Results should be similar to L24.S22: regions of similar colours form clusters but they are not spatially compact. If object has very different colour(s) than background then a reasonable segmentation may be possible, but otherwise probably not.

b-d. As discussed on email. Can provide more details later after seeing some submissions.
